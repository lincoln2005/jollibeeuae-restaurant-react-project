# Jollibeeuae

## Motivation
The motivation is simple, Best Development Experience and App performance.
1. `redux` store and middlewares as the state management.
2. `webpack` config for development and production.
3. Enable Hot-reload.
4. Configure `babel`, `eslint`, `jest` and more...
5. If project gets bigger, you need to setup some plugins such as `happypack`, `webpack-dll-plugin` to reduce webpack build time.

So I created this project and covers all the above settings, handling data flow and business logic.

## Uses

* `react` as the view.
* `react-router` v4 as the router.
* `react-loadable` provides component based code splitting
* `react-helmet` provides control of the page head from within components.
* `redux` as the state management container.
* `redux-saga` deal with asynchronous action flow.
* `react-router-redux` sync your router with redux state
* `reselect` to avoid frequent re-render that improve performance.
* `styled-components` helps you organize CSS in react project.
* `font-awesome` as the Icons
* `babel` v7 for es6+ support and load babel-polyfill on-demand.
* `isomorphic-fetch` for http request.

## Features

### Best Developer Expreience

* `webpack` v4 for both development and production bundles.
* `webpack-DLL-plugin`, `cache-loader`, `happypack` for faster rebuild time.
* `react-hot-loader` enable hot-reload both client and server-side.
* `redux-devtools` for state history, playback, enable Time travel (you can also use redux-devtools-extension instead).
* `webpack-bundle-analyzer` to review webpack output files with an interactive zoomable treemap.
* `ESLint` maintain your code quality with ease.
* `Prettier` keep code style consistency, it will performing code formatting when commit.
